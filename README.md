I am creating my own physics engine currently entirely in python. I have implemented basic physics including forces, acceleration, mass, position, and velocity. I hope to eventually be able to move this to c++ however I currently do not know the language.

I am following this article about how to create a physics engine in c++ however I am translating it to python.

You can use the window.py to render the engine aslong as you have pygame installed. Additionally in the future I hope to create my own sandbox allowing me to apply forces and create objects. Possibly within tkinter or pygame depending on what I want to render on.

NEXT STEPS:
    - multiple elements
    - friction
    - fluids
    - sandbox
    - c++??
