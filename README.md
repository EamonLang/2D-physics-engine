I am creating my own physics engine currently entirely in python. I have implemented basic physics including forces, acceleration, mass, position, and velocity. I hope to eventually be able to move this to c++ however I currently do not know the language.

I am following this article about how to create a physics engine in c++ however I am translating it to python.

I am going to implement pygame to render an actual screen and move objects around visually instead of just looking at coordinates in the terminal. Additionally in the future I hope to create my own sandbox allowing me to apply forces and create objects. Possibly within tkinter or pygame depending on what I want to render on.

*Its important to note that currently window.py is not functional and only engine.py works. This should be fixed soon once I connect them. They are not connected because I originally created an old engine that wasnt great and instead of making a new folder I just restarted.

NEXT STEPS:
    - collisions
    - collision responses
    - sandbox
    - c++??
